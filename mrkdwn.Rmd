## Data Mining Group Project

The "419" or "Nigerian Letter" dataset is a collection of fradulent letters sent to individuals, typically asking for banking information so that funds may be transferred to the user.

The data set can be found at <https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/fraudulent-email-corpus> and various other places.

This page was made for the Data Mining Course at Kent State University, and employs Text-Mining and Clustering methodologies to display graphics that depict the data set based on word frequency, and word grouping.

The code is hosted on github at <https://github.com/jasonbconley/DataMiningProject>
